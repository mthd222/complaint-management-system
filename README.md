### **Creating an Admin User**

By default, all registered users have the `user` role. To create an admin:

1.  Register a new user through the application's UI.
2.  Connect to your MongoDB database using a tool like MongoDB Compass or the shell.
3.  Navigate to the `complaint_system` database and open the `users` collection.
4.  Find the user you just created and edit their document.
5.  Change the `role` field from `"user"` to `"admin"`.
6.  Log in with this user's credentials to access the admin dashboard.
